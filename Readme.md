# Basic CI-CD Test

setting up a basic CI/CD pipeline for a web application. The application consists of a simple static website and a basic RESTful API.

## Tasks

1. Version Control (Git):

    - [x] Create a Git repository for any test web application.
    - [x] Commit the initial codebase including the static website and any sample test API.

2. CI/CD Pipeline

    - [x] Choose a CI/CD tool (e.g., **GitHub Actions**, Jenkins).
    - [x] Set up a basic pipeline that triggers on each commit to the develop branch.
    - [ ] Include stages for building and deploying both the static website and API.

3. Automated Testing:

    - [ ] Implement a simple automated test for the API (e.g., a basic endpoint response check).
    - [ ] Ensure that the CI/CD pipeline fails if the test fails.

4. Deployment:

    - [ ] Deploy the static website to a simple web server.
    - [ ] Deploy the API to a server, ensuring that it can handle basic HTTP requests.
